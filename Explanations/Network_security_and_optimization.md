### Network Security and Optimization

#### Prim's Algorithm

- Network Topology Optimization.
- Construction of minimum spanning tree for optimizing network connectivity.
- Helps in identification critical nodes for security monitoring and resource allocation.

#### Floyd Warshall Algorithm

- Can be used for Firewall rules optimization.
- Shortest paths between all pair of nodes(switches and routers).
- Network security with minimized latency.
