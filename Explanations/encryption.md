### Encryption

#### Catalan numbers and lattice path combinatorial problem

- The Catalan-number-based keys can be used to encrypt data using the Lattice Path encryption algorithm.[1]
- This algorithm leverages the binary representation of the key to guide a path through a discrete lattice, with the 1s and 0s determining the movement.

#### AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

- It is widely adopted due to its efficient performance. It uses symmetric encryption, ensuring that both encryption and decryption are fast and secure.
- It is a global standard for encryption, recognized by various organizations and governments worldwide. Its standardization ensures interoperability thereby ensuring secure transmission and reception(secure communication).

#### RSA(Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)

- As it is an assymetric encryption technique it uses public and private keys thereby enabling secure communication.
- The strength of security depends on the strength of the key.
- Based on the princple that the encryptrd text can only be decrypted by the one with private key.
