### Network Traffic Analysis

Graphs are employed to represent and analyze network topologies. Nodes may represent devices (computers, routers) and edges represent connections. Analyzing the graph structure helps in identifying vulnerabilities and potential attack paths.

#### A\* Search(Best-First-Search)

- Path finding in network traffic.
- to find optimal routes in network graphs, aiding in efficient routing and traffic management to prevent congestion and potential security breaches.

#### DFS and BFS

- network exploration

#### Fenwick tree

Fenwick trees can be used for

- network traffic analysis.
- monitor login attempts to detect unusual spikes which might indicate a brute-force attack.
