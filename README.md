### Introduction

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, and damage. It involves deploying measures like firewalls, encryption, and secure authentication to safeguard sensitive information. As digital threats continue to evolve, cybersecurity professionals constantly adapt and innovate to stay ahead. By detecting vulnerabilities, responding to incidents, and implementing preventive measures, they ensure the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of digital assets. In today's interconnected world, effective cybersecurity is essential for both individuals and organizations to mitigate risks and maintain trust in the digital ecosystem.<br>

### Use Cases

### 1. Data Integrity Verification

Data integrity verification is important for protecting data from unauthorized access,corruption and other cyber threats.The verification guarantees data accuracy making organizations to confidently rely on information.It helps in ensurin the data remains consistent and unchanged by unauthorized entities throughout its lifetime.

### 2.IP Routing

IP routing is crucial for cyber security by helping in correct forwarding of data packets across networks.It helps in traffic Managment,IP-spoofing and mitigating DDos attacks. Also,it enables network segmentation thereby reducing malware spread.

### Challenges:

Scalability,Security Vulunerabilities.

### Market Benifits:

Enhanced security, Improved traffic managment.

### 3.Key Generation for Encryption and Decryption

The strength of a network basically depends on the difficulty for the hacker to obtain the plain text from the cipher text.The strength of this cipher text often depends on the keys used.For any safe network it is critical to have a stronger key making it impossible for the hacker to hack.

#### Challenges:

Stronger Unique inaccessible Key generation.

#### Market Benifits:

Secure Network.

### 4.Data Compression

The primary goal of compression is in maintaining the integrity of the data/file while reducing its storage space.

- Compression before Encryption- An extra layer of security as encrypted data is not directly decipherable by malicious entities.
- Storage Optimization- reducing the high cost investment on disk space for cybersecurity companies which have vast amount of databse.

#### Challenges:

storage efficiency

#### Market Benifits:

Bandwidth optimization,Cost Reduction,Improved Performance,Enhanced security.
